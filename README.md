# pastejs-docker-compose

A docker-compose file to run an instance of paste. See: https://github.com/bfellows37/pastejs

## How to run

1. clone repo
2. change to repo directory
3. (optional) edit the `app.env` and `srv.env` files as necessary. It will work without editing but probably isn't as secure or whatever.
4. type `docker-compose up`
5. navigate to `http://localhost:80`
6. enter a username and password, if the user doesn't exist they will be created.
